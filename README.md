# Application of Reproducibility Research with Software Testing Techniques

  ARRSTT is a framework designed to implement and execute software testing techniques under an experimental environment. The framework is implemented using Java 8 thus yielding interoperability and compatibility with libraries and frameworks for existing testing techniques in Java.

  ARRSTT can be used for: learning, experimental studies and reproduction of experiments
