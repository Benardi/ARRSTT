# Application-of-Reproducibility-Research-with-Software-Testing-Techniques

  ARRESTT is a framework designed to implement and execute software testing techniques under an experimental environment. The framework is implemented using Java 8 thus yielding interoperability and compatibility with libraries and frameworks for existing testing techniques in Java.

  ARRESST can be used for: learning, experimental studies and reproduction of experiments
